# DIY_small6BayNAS
This project is my first attempt on creating a small form factor mITX NAS with 6 Bays and a picoPSU.  You can easily make it yourself out of some soft wood by using nothing more than precission saw and a drill. The files are made with Inventor 2020. Step files are included as well. You can also find the project on thingiverse.
